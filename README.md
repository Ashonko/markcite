# ðŸ”­ MarkCite

At MarkCite, we have various smaller products that we believe are better to share with the community. So that everyone may collaborate and we can learn alongside too.

We will publish some of the essential APIs and scripts that support our products, such as MarkCite Tools, SciRx, SmartPedi, and others, in this repository.
